Quick Intro to Distributed Systems

Distributed systems enable some of these key
technologies and functionalities that we use so
frequently


The next few slides will show the use of distributed
systems across many real-world industries


Industries enabled

by Distributed Systems

Retail

And so many


Healthcare

Manufacturing

Others…


Walmart

•   Walmart is the world’s largest discount retailer selling a wide
variety of merchandise

•   Large number of stores across 15 countries, more than 8500
stores

•   World’s largest private employer with 1.4 million employees
worlwide & 20 million people visit its stores every day [HBS
9704430]

•   Private satellite-communications IT system communicates
point-of-sale data among stores, distribution centers &
suppliers.

•   Distributed Data management is needed here to facilitate
smooth information flow across the supply chain and also for
business analytics


Inditex

•   One of the world's largest fashion retailers

•  5.221 stores in 78 countries

•   Brands owned by Inditex: Zara, Pull & Bear, Massimo Dutti,
Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home, Uterqüe

•   Best-cost provider strategy targeting the value-conscious
segment

•   Market focus

•  Fashion-conscious young people and teenagers

How does Inditex use distributed systems to achieve
its mission?


Use of distributed systems by Inditex

•  Centralized Distribution of merchandise powered by IT
communication technologies

– Autonomous store managers send customer feedback (e.g.,
what products are people buying?) from point-of-sale IT
systems to headquarters.

– Headquarters uses this information as feedback to
determine which designs to dispatch to stores at least twice
a   week.

– Allows for quick response to changing market demands


How Amazon uses distributed systems

•  Amazon Price Check mobile app gives incentives to
users for finding in-store prices of products

– This is technically called mobile crowdsourcing; see the next
2 slides for a quick overview of mobile crowdsourcing

•  Observe that it enables Amazon to collect intelligence
about competitors about product pricing

•  Amazon's recommendation system obviously uses
data analytics

•  Uses about 1 million Hadoop clusters for various
functionalities e.g., machine learning, recommendation
system   etc.

How Macy’s uses distributed systems and
Big Data Analytics

•   Macy’s is a retailer based in the US

•   Collects Big Data about what customers want based on several
factors e.g., pricing, demographics, seasons etc.

•   Evaluates sentiments (from social media) about given products

•   Helps them to understand customer preferences about which
brands are more popular and establish a connect with
customers at a more fine-grained level

•   Such predictive analytics facilitates effective customer
segmentation as well

How retail companies use Behavioral Analytics


•    Target

enabled by distributed systems

–   Tries to predict life changes (e.g., marriage, divorce etc.) of their 
customers

–   using behavioural analytics to understand the shopping behaviour of 
customers

–   Based on the predictions, they send targeted promotions to customers for 
relevant products

•    Nordstrom

–   225 retail outlets

–   Generates Big Data (in petabytes) from 4.5 million Pinterest followers; 
300,000 Twitter
followers & 2 million likes on Facebook

–   Tracks customer behaviour as customers walk inside the retail stores e.g., 
at parts of the
store, how much time do customers spend?

–   The focus is on personalization based on customer preferences to determine 
promotions of
products to relevant customers in a targeted manner

•    Kohl’s

–   Keeps track of customer’s online browsing history

–   Sends offers to customer’s phones when they come to the store

–   gives them in-store discount offers & promotions

How Big Data and distributed systems are
used in Food Industry

•  McDonald’s

– 34000 restaurants;

– 69 million customers in 118 countries

– 62 million daily customer traffic

– Sells 75 burgers every second

– (Pay particular attention to the scale of McDonald’s operations)

•  Uses Big Data to improve operational efficiencies and
improve customer experience

•  How long are customers waiting for their food? What kind of
ordering patterns exist?

How Big Data and distributed systems are
used in Airline Industry

•  Delta Airlines

– Tracks social media (tweets) to determine customer sentiment
about various aspects of their flying experience

• Delays, in-flight entertainment, lost baggage, connecting flights

– Facilitates in brand loyalty by responding proactively to customer
concerns

In all of these above industries and
application scenarios, observe how
distributed systems enable the processing
of     data collected at geographically
distributed nodes. Also, observe
transparency       & scalability aspects
