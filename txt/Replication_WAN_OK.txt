Anirban Mondal , Ashoka University

These slides are adapted from the following keynote talk of Anirban Mondal at
HADIS  2005  (Copenhagen,  Denmark):  Effective  dynamic  replication  in  wide-
area    network    environments:   A    perspective.    Authors:   Anirban    
Mondal
(University of Tokyo) and Masaru Kitsuregawa (University of Tokyo), 2005


Importance of Data Replication

■ Availability

■ Reliability

■ Query response times


Replication in WANs

■  Extremely challenging in practice

■  The next set of slides will discuss the key issues and
trade-offs associated with replication in Wide Area
Network (WAN) environments

■  Remember that large-scale geographically distributed
systems are of paramount importance in today’s world

– Especially since such distributed systems enable key
applications such as search engines, e-commerce portals
etc.

■   The ability to replicate data appropriately in WAN environments
is critical to the success of such distributed systems

(Cont.)

Moving spatial data entails movement of indexes
Extract data from index and rebuild at destination

Each node maintains a separate index for

• its own data

•for migrated/replicated data

Dealing with  variations in disk space

• ‘Push’ non-hot data to large capacity peers

- Large-sized data: migration

- Small-sized data: replication

• Replicate small-sized hot data at small capacity peers

• Large-sized hot data: migration to large capacity peers
if peers are available, otherwise replication

Delete of infrequently accessed replicas

■  We focus on improving the performance-dependability
of unstructured P2P systems via dynamic replication

■   Load imbalance decreases P2Pdependability

■   Main contributions

space for storing replicas


Selection Criteria for destination peer

• Adequate available disk space

• Significant load difference with source peer

• Low data transfer time w.r.t. source peer

No large-scale studies have yet been performed on any
real P2P system for answering these two open questions

• Sheer scale of P2P networks

Active and passive replication are also applicable to GRIDs

• Slightly less challenging

• Nodes in GRIDs are dedicated

• Collection of user statistics is easier


Peer availability issue

Estimating peer availability is important for replication

Percentage of peer availability does NOT capture whether a
peer is likely to be available during a specific point in time

- Will peer X be available at 7 pm GMT?


Peer availability issue

Estimating peer availability is important for replication

Percentage of peer availability does NOT capture whether a
peer is likely to be available during a specific point in time

- Will peer X be available at 7 pm GMT?

How to estimate the probability of a peer X being available?

• Every peer interacting with X keeps a log of its
interactions with X and estimates X’s probability of being

available/online

• Different peers who interact with peer X may have
different views about X’s availability.

Possible Solution

Estimates among neighbouring nodes by
consensus


Determination of number of replicas

Challenging to know the existing no. of D’s replicas D

• D may be replicated by any downloader node

• Nodes do not inform the primary copy owner

• Determining primary copy owner is itself
challenging

• Nodes can delete replicas autonomously anytime

Key differences concerning Replication


Replication in clusters

Replication is definitive
Replicate at any node

Retrieve data from least loaded
node containing the data

Replication decision-making
involves complete knowledge

Usually homogeneous nodes
Centralized control ok

Replication in WANs

Replication is just a plan

Carefully select destination
node

Retrieve from nearest node
containing the data

Replication decision-making
involves incomplete knowledge

Mostly heterogeneous nodes
Avoid centralized control
